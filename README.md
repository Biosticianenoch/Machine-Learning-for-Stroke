**Machine-Learning-for-Stroke**

This repository contains various machine learning models trained on a stroke dataset using Caret in R. The repository also contains an interactive screening to developed by shiny to assess individuals who are at risk of developing stroke

**Study Objective**

This study aimed to develop a high-performing machine learning model trained on a stroke dataset and deploy it within an interactive Shiny web application. The integrated system is designed for practical use in real-world healthcare settings to facilitate stroke risk assessment, support early diagnosis, and promote personalized treatment strategies.
